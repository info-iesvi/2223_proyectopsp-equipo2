# APIs for our project
In this document, we will talk about some tested APIs that we think might work in our project.

## Oasis API
Oasis API allows you to select the specific data you want from the Amazon website in a JSON format and use it to create your own personal Amazon clone or any E-commerce application. It is not a Rest API, because it only uses the GET method to query the Amazon database.
<br>The query methods are:
- GET Amazon Product Offers
- GET Amazon Product Reviews
- GET Amazon Product Search Results
- GET Amazon Product Info
